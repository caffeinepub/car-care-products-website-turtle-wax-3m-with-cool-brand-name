  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko migration module that seeds additional products (IDs 2–8) for brands \"3M\" and \"Turtle Wax\" and updates ProductCard to use a fallback image when imgPath is empty or the image fails to load. However, it is unclear from the diff that the catalog will be non-empty on a fresh install (not just on upgrade/migration), and the new backend file/migration mechanism appears unrequested and may violate the “single actor in backend/main.mo” constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Populate the Motoko product catalog with additional products so the site shows more items on the homepage for the existing brands (\"Turtle Wax\" and \"3M\") without requiring any manual calls to addProduct.",
      "reason": "Products are added via a new migration function (backend/migration.mo) and a migration hook in backend/main.mo, but the diff does not provide clear evidence that this seeding runs on a fresh install (initial deployment) such that getAllProducts is non-empty without any manual calls. It may only apply during upgrade/migration.",

      "description": "Introduced a separate backend migration module/file and wired it into the actor via “(with migration = Migration.run)”.",
      "reason": "The request only asked to seed more products in the existing single-actor backend; adding a migration system/new backend file was not requested and may conflict with the constraint to keep backend as a single Motoko actor in backend/main.mo (no additional backend services/files).",
