  "summary": "Theme tokens were updated in global CSS and multiple key UI components (header, hero, brand sections/cards, footer) were restyled to use the new tokens with a green/yellow Turtle Wax-inspired palette. However, the diff also appears to introduce unrequested branding/name changes and substantial new/expanded marketing copy, which are outside the requested scope of theme/styling updates.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says not to rename the app unless requested; diff summary indicates branding defaults and .env were set to a specific new name/slug and index.html title updated.",
