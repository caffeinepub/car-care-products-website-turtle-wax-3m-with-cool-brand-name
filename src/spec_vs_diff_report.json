  "summary": "Implemented a new /all-products route and page using the existing products query and ProductCard grid; updated header navigation to link to All Products; enhanced product image handling (prefer product.imgPath, then mapped image, then fallback) across ProductCard, Product Details, Cart, and Wishlist; added uploadedProductImages helper and updated My Products form data model to include imgPath/originalMrp/discountedPrice and uploaded image selection; checkout includes address fields and payment method selection with validation (confirmation display not clearly evidenced due to truncation).",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add the 4 uploaded product photos as square-cropped static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated with the specified filenames.",
      "reason": "The diff adds a TypeScript list referencing these asset paths, but does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "requirement": "Order confirmation page displays the captured delivery address and selected payment method.",
      "reason": "CheckoutPage shows address state, payment method selection, and validation, but the diff excerpt is truncated before any explicit confirmation UI that displays the captured address and chosen payment method.",
