  "summary": "Most branding updates are implemented: header text and logo alt use a centralized BRANDING constant, About section references BRANDING.appName, footer copyright uses BRANDING.appName, and footer non-browser fallback slug uses BRANDING.appSlug. However, the HTML entry title remains hardcoded, which likely breaks the “single source of truth” requirement for the document title/rename-in-one-place goal.",

      "reason": "The app name still appears as a hardcoded string in frontend/index.html (<title>TorqueShine Supply - ...</title>), meaning a future rename would require changing both the centralized module/env and index.html to keep them aligned.",
