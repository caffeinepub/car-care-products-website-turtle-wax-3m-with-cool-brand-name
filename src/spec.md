# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site’s global UI theme to closely match a Turtle Wax-inspired color palette and text styling across all major sections and components.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global theme tokens (e.g., background/foreground/primary/secondary/accent/muted/border/ring) to align the site-wide palette and default text colors with the new Turtle Wax-inspired look.
- Adjust key frontend components’ Tailwind classes to consistently use the updated theme tokens for headings, links, buttons, cards, borders/dividers, backgrounds, and hover/active states.
- Ensure the updated palette avoids blue/purple as primary brand colors and maintains readable contrast across Header, Home hero, Brand/Brands sections, About, and Footer.

**User-visible outcome:** The site visually adopts a cohesive Turtle Wax-inspired theme, with consistent colors and text styling across navigation, hero, sections, cards, and footer.
